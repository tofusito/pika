## 💭 Philosophy

Pika was created with a simple philosophy in mind:

> **The greatest barrier to capturing ideas is the pressure to perfect them immediately.**

We believe:

1. **Capture without friction** - When inspiration strikes, you should be able to pika your thoughts without thinking about structure or format
2. **Enhance with intelligence** - AI can help transform raw thoughts into structured content after they're safely captured
3. **Keep it simple** - Note-taking shouldn't require learning complex systems or shortcuts

This philosophy guides every feature and design decision in Pika.
